			<p class="flavor">Whereas tieflings have fiendish blood in their veins, aasimar are the descendants of celestial beings. These folk generally appear as glorious humans with lustrous hair, flawless skin, and piercing eyes. Aasimar often attempt to fass as humans in order to right wrongs and defend goodness in the Material Plane without drawing undue attention to their celestial heritage. They strive to fit into society, although they usually rise to the tip, becoming revered leaders and honorable heroes.</p>
